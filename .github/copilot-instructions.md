# copilot-instructions.md — OpenFlow Atlas

> A product & engineering guide for building a RAG-powered dashboard that maps user questions to matching **business processes** and renders **BPMN** workflows with contextual metadata.

---

## 0) One-liner
OpenFlow Atlas transforms natural-language questions and user-provided documents into a ranked list of **public-sector business processes**, visualizes **BPMN 2.0** flows (generated by another system), and links them to responsible units, forms, and legal bases.

---

## 1) Product goals (MVP)
- **Findability:** Retrieve top-N processes that best match a user query.  
- **Explainability:** Display evidence (snippets + similarity scores + citations).  
- **Visualization:** Render BPMN 2.0 diagrams interactively (read-only).  
- **Traceability:** Maintain provenance to each document source.  
- **Contextual insight:** Show owners, SLAs, systems, KPIs, forms, laws.  
- **Sovereignty:** Deploy on government infrastructure (no external calls).  

Non-goals: process editing, full case handling, or complex analytics (v1).

## 2) Users & key journeys
- **Administrative staff:** Ask “How is procurement over 10 k EUR handled?” → see the current workflow and linked policies.  
- **Department head:** “Show onboarding process for interns.” → compare variants and responsible offices.  
- **New hire:** “What happens after invoice approval?” → guided exploration for self-training.


## 3) Assumptions
